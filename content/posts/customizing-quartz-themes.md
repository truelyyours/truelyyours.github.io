# Customizing Quartz Themes

While Quartz 4 looks great out of the box, customizing the theme lets you create a unique identity for your digital garden.

## Understanding Quartz Theming

Quartz 4 uses a component-based architecture where styling is handled through:

- **CSS variables** for colors and typography
- **Component styles** for layout and behavior
- **SCSS compilation** for advanced styling features

## Color Schemes

The easiest customization is adjusting the color palette. In `quartz.config.ts`:

```typescript
colors: {
  lightMode: {
    light: "#faf8f8",
    lightgray: "#e5e5e5", 
    gray: "#b8b8b8",
    darkgray: "#4e4e4e",
    dark: "#2b2b2b",
    secondary: "#284b63",
    tertiary: "#84a59d",
    highlight: "rgba(143, 159, 169, 0.15)",
  }
}
```

## Typography Choices

Typography significantly impacts readability and personality:

```typescript
typography: {
  header: "Schibsted Grotesk",
  body: "Source Sans Pro", 
  code: "IBM Plex Mono",
}
```

## Custom Components

For more advanced customization, you can create custom components:

1. Create a new component in `quartz/components/`
2. Implement the `QuartzComponent` interface
3. Add styling in the component's CSS
4. Include it in your layout configuration

## Layout Modifications

The `quartz.layout.ts` file controls component placement:

- **beforeBody**: Content that appears before the main article
- **left**: Left sidebar components
- **right**: Right sidebar components
- **afterBody**: Footer area components

## Advanced Styling

For complex theming, you can:

- Override CSS variables in `quartz/styles/custom.scss`
- Modify component styles directly
- Add new CSS animations and transitions
- Implement responsive design improvements

## Design Inspiration

Some design principles I follow:

- **Readability first**: Ensure text is easy to read in all conditions
- **Consistent spacing**: Use a systematic approach to margins and padding
- **Subtle animations**: Enhance UX without being distracting
- **Mobile-friendly**: Design for mobile devices from the start

## Testing Changes

Always test your customizations across:
- Different screen sizes
- Light and dark modes
- Various browsers
- Different content types

The goal is creating a cohesive experience that reflects your personality while maintaining excellent usability.
