# Building Your Digital Garden

A digital garden is more than just a blog—it's a living, evolving space where ideas can grow and connect organically.

## What Makes a Good Digital Garden?

Unlike traditional blogs, digital gardens embrace:

- **Evergreen content** that evolves over time
- **Bidirectional links** between related concepts
- **Work in progress** mindset—not everything needs to be polished
- **Non-linear navigation** encouraging serendipitous discovery

## My Approach

I organize my garden around several core principles:

### 1. Capture Everything
I use Obsidian to capture fleeting thoughts, detailed research, and everything in between. The key is reducing friction—if it's hard to add something, you won't.

### 2. Connect Ideas
The real magic happens when you start linking related concepts. These connections often reveal insights you wouldn't have found otherwise.

### 3. Tend Regularly
Like a real garden, a digital garden needs regular attention. I set aside time each week to:
- Review and refine existing notes
- Create new connections
- Archive outdated information

## Tools and Workflow

My current stack includes:
- **Obsidian** for writing and organizing
- **Quartz 4** for publishing
- **GitHub** for version control and automation

This combination gives me the flexibility to work locally while maintaining a public presence.

## Growing Your Own Garden

Start small and grow organically. Begin with topics you're passionate about, and don't worry about having a perfect system from day one.

The goal isn't to create a perfect reference—it's to build a tool that helps you think better.
